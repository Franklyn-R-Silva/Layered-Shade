## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- 🚀 **Framework migration**: rewritten from vanilla JS (MVC) to **Svelte 5 + Vite + TypeScript**.
  - Pure code-generation logic preserved in `src/lib/shadow.ts` (state + CSS/Dart/Tailwind).
  - Reactive `$state` singleton (`src/lib/state.svelte.ts`) replaces the manual controller wiring.
  - UI split into Svelte components; global CSS design system reused unchanged.
  - Typed domain model (`src/lib/types.ts`); `svelte-check` in build and CI.
  - ~99% coverage on the pure logic core retained (71 tests); production bundle ≈ 23 KB gzip (JS).
- 🏗️ **Build/deploy**: Netlify now runs `npm run build` → `dist/`; static assets moved to `public/`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Gradient stops mutation**: `getBackgroundCSS()` / `getBackgroundCSSForLayer()` no
  longer sort `layer.stops` in place, which corrupted stop order on every render.
- 🐛 **Tailwind export**: removed self-defeating escaping (parentheses were escaped then
  stripped) and normalized `rgba()` shadow values so `shadow-[...]`/`bg-[...]` are valid.
- 🐛 **Opacity display**: the opacity text field now shows the same 0–100 value as its slider.
- 🐛 **Reset consistency**: `reset()` restores the initial shadow opacity (0.2) instead of 0.5.
- 🐛 **Copy feedback**: the Tailwind tab now says "(Tailwind)" instead of "(Dart)".
- 🐛 **Shadow color control**: the color picker now initializes explicitly instead of relying
  on an implicit fallback.

### UI / Design

- 🎨 **Controls panel had no glass styling**: the stylesheet targeted a non-existent
  `#controls-container`; the real element is `#controls`, so the sidebar rendered without its
  glass card. Now both the controls and preview panels are consistent glass cards.
- 🎨 **Preview title overlap**: the "Preview" heading was absolutely positioned and could overlap
  the demo box on small screens; it now sits in normal flow with the box centered below.
- 🎨 **Footer contrast**: social links and the divider used near-invisible white-on-light colors;
  given visible backgrounds/borders suited to the light theme.
- 🎨 **Preview box** initial color synced to the model default (`#ffdd00`), removing a color flash.
- ♿ **Reduced motion**: added `prefers-reduced-motion` support to stop the floating blobs and
  fade transitions; mobile drops the sticky preview and oversized min-height.

### Added

- 🧪 **Regression tests**: coverage for the fixes above (133 tests total).
- 🔍 **SEO**: canonical link, absolute `og:image`/`twitter:image`, JSON-LD `WebApplication`
  schema, Fira Code font import, and `sitemap.xml`.
- 📱 **PWA**: `manifest.json` and `apple-touch-icon` for installability.
- ♿ **Accessibility**: `:focus-visible` indicators for preset buttons and range sliders.

### Changed

- 📊 **Honest coverage**: badges/notes now reflect that tests cover core logic (~99%), with
  the DOM/controller layers verified manually.
